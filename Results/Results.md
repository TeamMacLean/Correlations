In every case, the increase in the number of divisions decrease the correlation between the ratios (decrease the fitness)


I am tented to say that the correlation is in general better when we have a higher number of heterozygous SNPs (1/500). I kept the number of homozygous SNP more or less constant for all the genome sizes in these examples. 

Effect of the contig size on the correlation
